# Git And Github

 ## Basics 

- **`Git`** is a version control system that is used to track changes to your files. It is a free and open-source software that is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Remember, GIT is a software and can be installed on your computer.

- **`Github`** is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Github is an online platform that allows you to store and share your code with others. It is a popular platform for developers to collaborate on projects and to share code. It is not that Github is the only provider of Git repositories, but it is one of the most popular ones.

- **`Version Control System`**
  - Version control systems are used to manage the history of your code. They allow you to track changes to your files and to collaborate with others.Consider version control as a checkpoint in game. You can move to any time in the game and you can always go back to the previous checkpoint. This is the same concept in software development.

 ## Terminologies

  - Repository:  
    A repository is like a folder on your computer, but it is more than just a folder. It can contain other files, folders, and even other repositories. You can think of a repository as a container that holds all your code.

 - Logs:   
    **`git log`** command will show you the history of your repository. It will show you all the commits that were made to the repository. You can use the --oneline flag to show only the commit message. This will make the output more compact and easier to read.

- .gitignore:  
    Gitignore is a file that tells git which files and folders to ignore. It is a way to prevent git from tracking certain files or folders. You can create a gitignore file and add list of files and folders to ignore by using the following command:

```sh
  node_modules
  .env
  .idea

```
