⭐️Why Java?
    1) Compile Time Env: Source code  => bytecode(by JVM)
    2) Run Time Env: Scanning is happened at the runtime.

    👉This Bytecode is platform independent.
    👉Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code
        is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
